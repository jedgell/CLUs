This is the top directory of the CLUs.

The CLUs are here because I get peeved having to remember that I have to 
make a directory before I mount a drive in linux. Or that I have to
remember to add xargs to a find to grep the results.

Directory Structure:

-README	 		--this file
|
+filesystem 		--filesystem CLUs
+-mkmnt.sh 		--takes the name of a device (arg 1) in /dev and makes a dir 
|				in /mnt and mounts the device at that location
|				example: mkmnt cdrom
|				would run: mkdir /mount/cdrom; mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom;
+-fixgrep.sh 		--takes the name of a directory (arg 1) and file type (d or f - arg 2) 
|				and passes arg 3 as the grep first argument (FInd Xargs GREP)
|				example: fixgrep /home/user f search\ phrase
|				would run: find /home/user -type f | xargs grep search\ phrase

Hope they're useful. Add back if you know a way to make a particular CLU
more effective.

Note: I can't provide any licensing for these utilities because many of
them combine other programs with differing licenses (GPL v1,v2,v3; BSD, etc).

Best to say that if a CLU's constituent programs don't extend their licensing
mode, the CLU falls under GPL v2, however, always refer to constituent
programs licensing models before assuming GPL v2 applies.

Thx,
